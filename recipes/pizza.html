    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Create one the best food dish that ever existed on this earth</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons yeast</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons warm water</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon xanthan gum</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup no sugar added pizza sauce (such as Rao's®)</li>
        <li>2 ounces sliced pepperoni</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Mix yeast into warm water in a small cup, stirring to dissolve. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese into a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 90 seconds, stirring every 30 seconds until completely melted. Stir in the yeast mixture and egg; stir to combine. The mixture will not incorporate well at this point.</li>
        <li>Stir in almond flour, xanthan gum, and salt. If difficult to mix, reheat in the microwave for 20-30 seconds to soften the cheese. Stir again until well incorporated. Knead dough by hand for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place dough on the prepared baking sheet and press with your fingers into a thin crust 11 to 12 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Spread pizza sauce over pizza. Top with remaining 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese, then scatter pepperoni on top.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes. Cut into 6 slices.</li>
    </ol>
